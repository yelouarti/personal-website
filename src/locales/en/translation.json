    "technicalExpertiseP2": "This visualization showcases my technical profile across five key dimensions of software development. My strongest foundation lies in backend development, where I have designed and implemented numerous microservices using Java and Spring. This is complemented by my architectural expertise, which I have contributed both as a hands-on developer and as a solution architect in large projects. In the area of testing, my years of experience in implementing comprehensive testing strategies are reflected—from unit tests to system-wide performance tests. I have continuously built and practically applied my DevOps skills alongside backend development and architectural work, routinely working with technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm. In the frontend domain, I have successfully executed independent projects using Angular and React.",
